/**
 * VaultFileSystem — the Obsidian implementation of {@link LabnoteFs}.
 *
 * Backed by Obsidian's `DataAdapter` (`app.vault.adapter`), which speaks
 * vault-relative POSIX paths and is fully async. We deliberately use the
 * *adapter* rather than the `Vault`/`TFile` API because sample/workflow storage
 * files (`resources/labsamples/*.json`, catalog JSON) are plain data files that
 * may live outside the markdown file cache, and the adapter gives uniform
 * path-based access to them.
 *
 * Atomicity (see the `LabnoteFs.modify` contract): `modify` delegates to the
 * adapter's own `process()`, whose synchronous callback is exactly the shape the
 * contract requires. Two gaps `process()` cannot close are covered by a
 * per-path queue: creating a file that does not exist yet (`process` reads
 * first, so it cannot), and plain `write` calls landing in the middle of
 * someone else's read-modify-write. What none of this covers is a second
 * Obsidian process on the same vault — the queue is per plugin instance.
