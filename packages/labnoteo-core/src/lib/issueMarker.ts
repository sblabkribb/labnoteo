/**
 * `@issue` markers — "open a GitHub Issue about THIS spot in the note".
 *
 * Discussion comes up anywhere in a note, but Markdown has no thread to hold a
 * question, so the marker promotes one line to an Issue. The grammar extends
 * the sample-reference convention researchers already use
 * (`@type;ID;content`), so there is nothing new to learn:
 *
 *   3차 시도에서만 수율 40%. @issue;ISS-mkd8x3k;시드 배양 시간 차이 때문인지 논의 필요
 *
 * A marker runs from `@issue` to END OF LINE, so there is at most one per line.
 * Being an explicit token it carries no false-positive risk, which is why the
 * automation may act on it deterministically while free-text scanning stays
 * banned.
 *
 * The ID is what makes the Issue stable: the topic sentence can be reworded
 * without orphaning the discussion it opened.
 *
 * Domain-only (no Obsidian/Node APIs) because three callers must agree on the
 * grammar — the plugin command that writes markers, `issue-sync` that promotes
 * them, and `validate` that reports broken ones.
